# NEO (Near Earth Objects) Data Analysis
This Python script allows you to fetch and analyze Near Earth Objects (NEO) data from NASA's API. It retrieves NEO data for a specified date range and displays relevant information such as object name, estimated diameter, close approach date, and miss distance.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
requests library (pip install requests)
texttable library (pip install texttable)
Usage
Clone the Repository:

# Bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/neo-data-analysis.git
Run the Script:

# Navigate to the project directory and execute the script:

bash
Copy code
python neo_data_analysis.py
Follow the Prompts:

Enter the start date (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
Enter the end date (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
View the NEO Data:

The script will fetch NEO data for the specified date range and display it in tabular format.

# Sample Output
Name of Object	Estimated Diameter (min)	Estimated Diameter (max)	Close Approach Date	Miss Distance (km)

Example Object	0.002	0.004	2024-02-28	50000

# Functionality
-User Input: The script prompts the user to input a start date and an end date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. It ensures that the dates are entered correctly and that the start date is before the end date.

-API Request: Using the provided dates, the script constructs a request to NASA's API, which returns data about NEOs that were observed within the specified time frame.

-Data Analysis: The script parses the JSON response from the API and extracts relevant information about each NEO, such as its name, estimated diameter, close approach date, and miss distance from Earth.

-Tabular Display: The retrieved data is presented in a tabular format using the texttable library, making it easy for the user to visualize and understand.

-Iterative Approach: The script iterates through the dates within the specified range, enabling the user to analyze NEO data for multiple days if desired.

-Customization: Users can easily modify the script to perform additional analysis or to visualize the data in different ways based on their requirements.
